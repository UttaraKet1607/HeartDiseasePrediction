# HeartDiseasePrediction

One of the prominent diseases that affect many people during middle or old age is heart disease, and in many cases it eventually leads to fatal complications. Heart disease (HD) has been considered as one of the complex and life deadliest human diseases in the world.
Age, sex, smoking, family history, cholesterol, poor diet, high blood pressure, obesity, physical inactivity, and alcohol intake are considered to be risk factors for heart disease, and hereditary risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes also lead to heart disease.

## Dataset:
The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression) provides the patients’ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes. Each attribute is a potential risk factor. There are both demographic, behavioural and medical risk factors.

Algorithms used:
1) K nearest neighbours
2) Random forests
3) Logistic regression

An ensemble learning technique called “voting classifier” is also implemented. 
A Voting Classifier is a machine learning model that trains on an ensemble of numerous models and predicts an output based on their highest probability of chosen class as the output.
